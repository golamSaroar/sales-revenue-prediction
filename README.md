## Predicting Sales Revenue using Multiple Linear Regression

In this project, I've built a simple linear regression model to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through mediums such as TV, radio, and newspaper. The project makes use of the scikit-learn module for calculating the linear regression, pandas for data management, and seaborn for plotting.

Please have a look at the notebook [here](predict-sales-revenue), or open it on [Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yz4JlzSxHfMOmaFWF6fNs7ClzZYyWCi5/view?usp=sharing).
